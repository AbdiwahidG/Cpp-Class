Sorting Techniques.


**BUBBLE SORT**
Bubble sort is one of the most straightforward sorting algorithms. In this sorting technique, we begin by comparing the first two elements of the array and checking if the first element is greater than the second element; if it is, we will swap those elements and move forward to the next element.

**Complexity Analysis of Bubble Sort**
In Bubble Sort, n-1 comparisons will be done in the 1st pass, n-2 in 2nd pass, n-3 in 3rd pass and so on. So the total number of comparisons will be,

_(n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ..... + 3 + 2 + 1
Sum = n(n-1)/2
i.e O(n2)
_
Hence the time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n2).

**The main advantage of Bubble Sort is the simplicity of the algorithm.**

The space complexity for Bubble Sort is O(1), because only a single additional memory space is required i.e. for temp variable.

Also, the best case time complexity will be O(n), it is when the list is already sorted.

Following are the Time and Space complexity for the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n2)
Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n)
Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
